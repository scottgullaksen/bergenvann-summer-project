# Bergen Vann Summer Project

Bergen vann has available, but currently unused, data from sensors equpped in their drain pipes and -pumps. The intuition is that this data should be helpful for detecting, and perhaps even anticipating, unwanted events such as pipe leaks or pump shutdowns. However, as of now this data is neither presented or made available in a way that makes such analyses possible. The aim of this project is to enable visualization of the data to
1. Showcase that anamoly detection is indeed possible
2. Help Bergen Vann understand their data better
3. See value in their unused data

There's also some correlated metereology data which should help for predictive purposes.
